Xhotkeys provides a simple and easily configurable hotkey launcher for the X-Window System, binding keys and mouse buttons to configurable commands. It should work on all desktops (Gnome, KDE, Xfce, ...) available for the UNIX-like operating systems (GNU/Linux, BSD, ...). At this moment xhotkeys configuration file must be editer manually, but future versions will provide a GTK configurator.

{{{
[calculator]
    name = Calculator
    binding-type = keyboard
    binding = <ControlMask>2
    directory = ~
    command = /usr/bin/xcalc
    shell = no

[abiword]
    name = Abiword
    binding-type = mouse
    binding = <ControlMask><Mod1Mask>3
    directory = ~/docs
